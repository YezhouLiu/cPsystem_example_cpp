A simple cP system example, the system has: (1) three terms f(aaaaa), f(bbbb), and f(ccc); (2) three stateless rules: f(aX) ->+ f(eX), f(bX) ->+ f(dfgX), and f(cX) ->+ f(X).

The rules and the system are only for illustration purposes.

To compile, build, and run the project, CMake is needed. 

The build and run commmands are written as .bat and .sh files.
